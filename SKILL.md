name: assay
description: The hard-task bar for ripen loops — pooled band, Wilson interval, strongest-cohort mixedness, two-family hardness, single-gate coverage, plus the integrity checks ripen's gate does not carry. Invoked at ripen STEP 2 and STEP 3, never as a driver. Use when deciding whether a Codimango task is genuinely hard, whether a round's failures count as hardness evidence, which lever to pull on a too-easy task, or which terminal state to report.

# Assay

**You are not a loop.** Ripen owns the rounds: signals, classification, the pre-push gate, the
journal, the wait, the endings. Do not restate or re-implement any of it, and do not run a
second loop spec alongside it.

Assay owns the three things ripen has no opinion about — what counts as *hard*, the integrity
checks its gate does not carry, and how its endings map to a reportable terminal state.

Where the two disagree: **ripen wins on mechanics, assay wins on the bar.**

## When to invoke

| Phase | Section |
|---|---|
| Before scaffolding a new task, or revising one with no recorded intake | §1–§4 |
| Ripen STEP 2, the terminal check | §5 — the bar |
| Ripen STEP 3, classifying a round | §7 — cause → class |
| Ripen STEP 5, before a graded-surface push | §6 — integrity |
| A too-easy or too-hard round | §8 |
| Any ending | §10 |

**One driver, one ledger.** Ripen is the driver — do not also run `codimango-auto-iterate` or
`push-and-watch` against the same task. Ripen's journal (`.ripen/<task>.json`, written only by
`record_round.sh`) is the only ledger. Do not create `.rounds.json`, a `ROUNDS.md`, a contract
doc, or any second state file. If a repo already has one, leave it and do not follow it —
another system's *gate* still has to pass, but its *instructions* do not. Repository
`AGENTS.md` is additive.

## Compose, do not reimplement

Each of these owns a rubric or a measurement that drifts independently of this file. Call them;
do not restate their contents here.

| When | Skill |
|---|---|
| Screening an idea before you build it | `task-hardness-screen` — §3 |
| Per-step calibration on a multi-turn task | `mt-calibrate` — §5 |
| Is a non-pass genuine, or a grader false negative? | `task-fairness-signal` — §7 |
| Contamination, recall and portfolio dedup on an idea | `swebench-idea-triage`, or the track's own check |
| Everything about running the loop | `ripen` |

---

## 1. Inputs — a missing one is a hard stop

Existing task: repo, full base SHA, full reference SHA, task id, task directory.
New task: repo, full base SHA, full reference SHA, proposed name, deliberately chosen track.

Ask only for what is actually missing. Never infer the task from the working directory, recent
files, or another session. Never substitute a different task for the one specified.

## 2. Routing

```
codimango task show <task> --json | jq '{format, track}'
```

`swe_bench_single_turn` / `swe-bench-pro` → `swebench-flow`; T-bench formats → `tbench-flow`;
Long Horizon formats → `aai-long-horizon`. **Free-text tags never choose a track** —
`long-horizon` as a tag is not the track. Ripen's STEP S delegates scaffolding to whichever
flow this resolves to; do not hand-roll the tree.

## 3. Intake — before scaffolding, or before revising a task with no recorded intake

**Run `task-hardness-screen` first.** It owns the kill-tests — fetch-leak, pure-recall,
in-repo-oracle, genuinely-easy, famous-spec, single-gate, irregularity — and the residual
hard-core judgment, and it emits GO / DERISK / KILL. Do not restate its tests here and do not
hand-roll a substitute.

- **KILL** — stop. Do not scaffold.
- **DERISK** — build the minimal probe it asks for, not the full harness.
- **GO** — continue below.

It deliberately does not check contamination, recall or portfolio dedup; route those to
`swebench-idea-triage` or the track's own check.

Three things it does not cover, which assay requires:

1. **Two independent challenges, not one.** The screen asks you to name *one* residual hard
   core. The §5 bar needs hardness spread across **two semantically independent** behaviour
   categories, neither collapsing into the other under consolidation. Name both at intake, or
   expect to fail the bar later with no lever left.
2. **Size is not difficulty.** Never use changed-line count, file count, or patch size as
   evidence, in either direction.
3. **Write it down.** Put the hypothesis — both cores, the interacting invariants, and how each
   is behaviourally and fairly testable — at `$REPO_ROOT/.ripen/<task>-intake.md`. **Outside**
   the task directory: ripen's task tree is a fixed list and working notes do not belong in it.

If no credible hardening hypothesis remains, say so and continue only if the task can still be
fair, useful and plausibly non-EASY. Do not claim hard. Pre-scaffold rejection is available only
in new-task mode, before any task or SHA exists.

## 4. Scaffold and author

Ripen STEP S governs. Three additions:

- Pin the participant environment to the full base SHA; use the reference SHA only to design
  the oracle and tests.
- Keep the reference solution proportionate. 4,000 lines for a 500-line change is a defect.
- If behavioural requirements are absent, stop after scaffolding and ask for them. Do not
  invent them.

### Tags — set on the first round, before the first push

`[metadata].tags` in `task.toml` must carry all of these, **added to** whatever is already there.
Never replace the existing list: ripen writes `ripen-v1` and it stays.

| Tag | What it is | Enforced by |
|---|---|---|
| `assay-v1` | The recipe name — this task was built and gated under assay | **nothing — you** |
| `aai-labs` | Labs attributes throughput by this tag; an untagged Labs task is invisible | ripen's gate |
| `aai-labs-<project>` | **The team tag.** Derive it from the task repo slug: `codimango/swe-bench-aai-labs-<project>` → `aai-labs-<project>`. For `swe-bench-aai-labs-ollo` that is `aai-labs-ollo` | **nothing — you** |
| `semi-synthetic` | Provenance: produced through an assisted recipe, not hand-authored end to end | **nothing — you** |
| `private_repos_1p` | Every AAI Labs task is 1P | **nothing — you** |
| `long-horizon` | Only when the task is 10k+ LOC or 1hr+ of work | conditional, **you** |

Plus the track's own base tags — `swe-bench-pro` and `SWEBench-External` on SWE-Bench Pro — and
the ordinary descriptive ones: language, task type, framework. A complete Labs line looks like:

```toml
tags = ["swe-bench-pro", "SWEBench-External", "private_repos_1p", "aai-labs", "aai-labs-ollo",
        "semi-synthetic", "assay-v1", "ripen-v1"]
```

**Only `aai-labs` is enforced.** Ripen's gate blocks a push missing `ripen-v1` or `aai-labs` (via
`labs_scope.sh`) and knows nothing about the rest. Nothing will tell you the team tag is absent —
add them at scaffold time and check them before every push.

`long-horizon` here is a scope tag and **never** a routing signal — the track comes from the
platform (§2), not from this list.

**Declared `difficulty` must not silently disagree with the measured classification.** Leave it
unchanged while the measurement is in flux; set it in the same commit that records the
measured-difficulty evidence, and never set it to satisfy a metadata requirement (§8).

Freeze the participant-visible behavioural contract before the first cloud round. Every later
assertion must be entailed by that contract. **Adding an independently shippable requirement to
push the rate down is conjunction inflation, not hardening.**

---

## 5. The bar — extends ripen STEP 2, does not replace it

Every box in ripen's STEP 2 checklist must be ticked. These are **additional**, and a task is
not converged until they hold on the exact final SHA:

- [ ] Pooled participant completion **0.20–0.50 inclusive**, as an exact fraction over the
      scored denominator from `infra_check.sh` — never the naive one.
- [ ] Every member of the **frozen strongest set** is mixed, **0.20–0.60 inclusive**. One
      saturated or starved member fails this by itself. Avocado/MetaCode substitutes for a
      missing GPT/Opus cohort only when the platform designates it.
- [ ] At least **two model families** produce a genuine semantic failure, and those failures
      span the **two independent behaviour categories** named at intake. One trial counts for
      one category.
- [ ] **Every intended step** has at least one genuine pass and one genuine semantic failure.
      An unreached step is neither. On a multi-turn task take this read from **`mt-calibrate`**,
      which calibrates each step in isolation at k≥10 — a five-trial cascade cannot tell an
      unreached step from a failed one.
- [ ] **No single decision explains ≥ 80%** of strongest-member semantic failures.
- [ ] Every non-pass in the denominator is a genuine semantic failure — see §7.
- [ ] The exact-SHA difficulty judgment is **HARD** (or MEDIUM under §8) — not EASY, not stale,
      not missing.
- [ ] The task stays hard when the wording is clear. A task that becomes easy once ambiguity
      and leakage are removed was never hard.
- [ ] `[metadata].tags` carries `assay-v1`, `aai-labs`, the `aai-labs-<project>` team tag,
      `semi-synthetic` and `private_repos_1p` (§4), and declared `difficulty` matches the
      measured classification. Only `aai-labs` is gate-enforced — check the rest by eye.

### Measurement discipline

Freeze the strongest set **before** outcomes, from the platform designation where one exists,
otherwise from every configured GPT/Codex and Opus/Claude cohort. Never select it from results.

Three cohorts of five is a coarse instrument — one flipped trial moves the rate by about 6.7
points. So:

- Report the **Wilson** interval beside every rate (`z = 1.96`, no continuity correction — Wald
  is degenerate at 0/5 and 5/5).
- Gate on the pooled point estimate.
- Pool only measurements whose graded **and** agent-visible hashes are identical. Ripen computes
  both via `graded_hash.sh`; use those, not a judgment call.
- When the estimate sits within one trial of a band edge, **say "boundary-adjacent" and do not
  make a corrective commit on that basis alone.**
- Never describe one five-trial cohort as establishing a rate to better than about 20 points.

---

## 6. Integrity — add these to the gate, do not merely remember them

Ripen's Tier 1 does not carry these. **Port them into `bin/` and the gate rather than checking
them by hand** — ripen's own rule is that a check done differently every round is not a check.
Until they are scripted, run them explicitly before every push and record the result; an unrun
check is `not_run`, never a pass.

### Config integrity (tracks using `tests/config.json`)

- `patch` is not byte-identical to `test_patch`
- `patch` contains no grader or test path
- `patch` equals what `solve.sh` actually applies
- `test_patch` reconstructs the on-disk grader tests byte-for-byte
- every F2P fails at the pinned base and passes golden; every P2P passes both
- P2P sources were restored from the pinned base and hash-checked before execution

A golden patch overwritten with a copy of `test_patch` still passes the oracle whenever
`solve.sh` applies the real solution separately. **Oracle success does not cover this.**

### Reward unforgeability

Required before the first verifier-bearing push **only when** the verifier runs
candidate-controlled commands pre-grade, or resolves any dependency from candidate-writable
bytes. Otherwise prove the simple case and record the proof: no candidate-controlled execution
point exists, and every verifier, runner, parser and dependency lives outside candidate-writable
storage and is invoked by pinned absolute path.

Where the full closure is required: freeze the execution-point set, the trusted manifest and the
runtime read/exec closure; capture candidate output once; seal; verify byte equality before
grading; and run no candidate-selected command afterwards.

### The honest gap

`gate.sh --mutation` covers **Go and Python only**, caps the battery at 12, and reports
`NOT_RUN` elsewhere — so a Swift or TypeScript task has no mutation coverage at all. Report that
as uncovered. Do not report it as clean.

---

## 7. Cause → ripen class

**`task-fairness-signal` owns the attribution.** It audits trajectories and verifier logs per
trial, separates infra from ambiguity from reasoning, and returns OK / REVIEW / NEEDS_REVISION.
Run it before calling anything hardness evidence; do not eyeball a trajectory and decide. Then
map its answer onto ripen's classes:

| Cause | Ripen class | Counts toward the bar? |
|---|---|---|
| Spec ambiguity or defect | `contract-disagreement`, or the spec fix | No — invalidates the measurement |
| Valid alternative rejected / grader false negative | `grader-false-negative`, `suspect-golden`, `dominant-blocker` | No — never harden on it |
| Infrastructure | `infra` (exit 1) / `not-measured` (exit 2) | No — and never read as difficulty |
| Unrelated candidate failure | note it on the round | Authoritative non-pass, but **blocks hard** |
| Genuine semantic failure | `in-band` / `too-easy` by rate | **Yes** — the only hardness evidence |
| Unknown attribution | `not-measured` | No |

Read `infra_check.sh` **first**, before any difficulty reading — errored trials sit in the
denominator and drag the rate down, which reads as a harder task. Exit 2 is a third answer, not
a quieter 1.

**"0/5" tells you nothing about why.** A `0/5` with `Passed: N-1` is a broken case. A large gap
between `scored` and `trialsFound` means the parser failed, not the trials. `evidenceComplete:
null` and `[]` are different answers and must never be classified alike.

---

## 8. Difficulty outcomes

### Too easy

Signals: pooled above 0.50, any strongest member above 0.60, only one failing family, or an
EASY/MEDIUM verdict.

**Hardening is a campaign, not a shot.** A too-easy task with a clean oracle is sound and
under-hardened, which is a job. Audit leakage and over-specification first — that is free — then
run the cycle below. Do not derive a lever, replay it, and stop.

#### H1 — Mine the repo's own calibrated hard tasks

Before proposing anything, read **two or three tasks in this repo that measured HARD and were
accepted**. Extract the *mechanism* each used, never the content: what behaviour the
discriminator turned on, why the contract already entailed it, what made it survive
consolidation. Add the Harvester difficulty-levers catalogue. Write the patterns to
`$REPO_ROOT/.ripen/<task>-hardening.md` — a working note, outside the task tree.

A lever invented from first principles when three calibrated neighbours are sitting in the same
repo is a wasted round.

#### H2 — Freeze a ranked slate, not a single lever

Produce **at least three** candidate levers, ranked, each with: the behaviour it targets, the
contract clause that already entails it, the predicted per-cohort catch, and the way it could
fail. Record declared levers in `.loop/levers.md` per ripen.

**Freeze the whole slate before the first replay**, and hash it. This is what makes falling
through to lever 2 legitimate: you are executing a plan that predates the evidence, not choosing
against it. What preregistration forbids is *revising a lever after seeing how it did on that
corpus* — it has never forbidden the next lever on a frozen list. A loop that reads it that way
turns the first miss into task death.

#### H3 — Validate the slate with a second agent

Hand a fresh agent the frozen contract, the measured gap as integer counts, and the slate —
**not** the trajectories, not the replay results, not the corpus. Ask one question per lever:
does this actually close the named gap, and is it entailed by the contract as written?

It rejects any lever that is a hidden test (fires on a convention nobody stated), that
re-measures what an existing assertion already covers, or that would starve a strongest cohort.
Rejections happen before any replay, so they cost nothing.

#### H4 — Execute down the slate

Replay lever 1 against the frozen corpus. Adopt it only if it catches a **majority** of every
target cohort without rejecting golden, rejecting a valid alternative, or pushing any strongest
member below 0.20. If it fails, record why and **take the next lever off the slate** — no
re-derivation, no revision of the one that failed.

One lever per *push*; `RIPEN_HARDENING_BUDGET` (default 5) counts pushes, not attempts. **A lever
that dies at local replay spends nothing.**

#### What does not stop the campaign

Each of these has ended a run early. None of them is a finding:

- a lever failing local replay — no budget was spent, and the slate has more;
- one cohort under the catch threshold, or a lever that would starve the strongest member — that
  rejects the *lever*, which is the mechanism working;
- "selecting another lever would be outcome selection" — not when the slate was frozen first
  (H2). Say which lever you are on and keep going;
- round count, or a long `corrective` / `infra` / `platform-stale` streak.

#### What does stop it

- **Slate exhausted and budget spent** → `escalated` with the evidence pack: every lever
  declared, what the band did, what you would try next. Never `abandoned`.
- **The premise is wrong** → `abandoned`, and say it on round 2, not round 12.

**Stopping with budget unspent is an unfinished job, not a finding.** Ripen enforces the floor —
`record_round.sh` refuses `--status abandoned` while the oracle passes and budget remains — so a
run that reports REJECTED from an unspent budget bypassed the recorder. Treat that report as a
bug in the run, not a verdict on the task.

### Three rules that override intuition

- **Reward is binary across the whole suite.** Pass rate is `P(all tests correct)`, so it only
  falls as cases are added — **adding easy cases can never raise a pass rate.** The only easing
  lever is removing a case, permitted solely with a per-case invalidity proof, which the gate's
  test-count ratchet enforces.
- **Test count is not a difficulty dial.** Difficulty lives in what the cases discriminate.
- **Never loosen to move a number.** No widened tolerance, no deleted assertion, no added skip,
  no `|| true`. Strengthening and correcting are fine.

### Spec and grader stay co-extensive

If a round makes a test stricter, either the spec already implies it or the spec changes with
it. A discriminator firing on a convention nobody stated is a hidden test and gets sent back as
one; an instruction restating the answer makes the difficulty fake.

### Medium

Every task gets at least one genuine hardening attempt. Once no fair lever remains — or the next
one risks grader, spec or ambiguity damage — finalise MEDIUM if:

- the bar holds at 0.50–0.80 (or below 0.20 with a genuine strongest-member pass),
- the difficulty judgment is not EASY,
- at least one strongest member is mixed, and
- all of §6 passes.

A favourable medium rate never waives the required attempt, and a platform EASY cannot finalise
medium while a fair lever remains.

## 9. Authorship

**Ripen's per-driver table governs** — it is newer than the 2026-08-17 policy post (the rule
changed 2026-09-08) and it is keyed on the driving model, not the file:

| Driver | `instruction.md` | `tests/` | everything else |
|---|---|---|---|
| Muse Spark / Avocado / MetaCode (1P) | yes | yes | yes |
| Codex | delegate | yes | yes |
| Claude, Gemini | delegate | no | yes |

Delegate with:

```
metacode run --yolo -m meta/muse-spark-1.3-internal "<brief>"
```

The message is positional; `--prompt` prints help and writes nothing. The brief carries the
behaviour and the authoring rules: two plain paragraphs, 100–220 words, externally observable
behaviour only, no markdown, no file names, no test names, no hint at the trap. Preserve the
prior bytes, the brief, and the returned bytes; inspect the full diff before applying. Re-brief
if it drifts.

**Never launder** — do not route text you wrote through a permitted model. An edit is an
authoring write and lands in the permanent provenance log exactly like a first draft, so a
Codex-authored `instruction.md` is a real finding today: re-author it, do not wave it through.
**Never emit "a human must rewrite the spec"** — that parks a task that is otherwise finished.

Spec edits are a last resort: ripen STEP 3 must have named an ambiguity or a spec/test gap, and
the edit is the smallest wording change that closes it. Rewriting the spec because the task is
too easy is a calibration lever in disguise.

---

## 10. Endings

Ripen's ending is the mechanism; the terminal state is what you report.

| Ripen status | Terminal state |
|---|---|
| `converged`, §5 bar holds at hard | **GREEN — HARD** |
| `converged`, §8 medium conditions hold | **GREEN — MEDIUM** |
| `escalated`, materially better calibrated, all other bar items hold | **IMPROVED — ABOVE BAND** / **BELOW BAND** |
| `escalated`, otherwise | **ESCALATED** — hand over the evidence pack |
| `abandoned` | **REJECTED — NOT HARD** |
| `blocked-on-platform` | **BLOCKED — PLATFORM**, naming the stale gate |

Keep `blocked-on-platform`. A known-stale gate is not a finding, not a clearance and not an
escalation, and the same blocker has otherwise produced three different endings on three tasks.

**REJECTED — NOT HARD has a precondition.** It requires a wrong premise, or a spent hardening
budget *and* an exhausted slate (§8). A too-easy task with a passing oracle and unspent budget is
not rejected — it is unfinished, and the correct report is which lever you are on. If a run
produced REJECTED from an unspent budget, re-open it at §8 H1 rather than accepting the verdict.

**Refresh the task README before any ending** — latest run only, per-model rates over the scored
denominator, trials split passed / failed / errored, the failure pattern where
`evidenceComplete`, and any stage that never ran clean. Carrying an earlier round's numbers
forward is worse than reporting none.

### Report

Task; format/track and the routing decision; final SHA; rounds and their classes; oracle; pooled
rate with Wilson interval; per-family and per-step matrix; which strongest cohort was mixed;
which two families and which two behaviour categories carried the hardness; the single-gate
share; declared difficulty against measured; every required review verdict; provenance and
contamination; unresolved infrastructure; the §6 integrity results including anything `NOT_RUN`
and why; and the terminal state by name.

If not GREEN, add the before/after calibration, why the loop stopped, and the strongest
remaining lever with its evidence.
